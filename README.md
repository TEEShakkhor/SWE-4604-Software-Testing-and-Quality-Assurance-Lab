# SWE-4604-Software-Testing-and-Quality-Assurance-Lab
Overview
This repository showcases hands-on experience with various testing techniques, tools, and frameworks conducted for the lab tasks of SWE 4604 course. Each lab focuses on different aspects of software testing, including unit testing, API testing, performance testing, UI automation, and systematic test design.

Lab Tasks
Java Unit Testing with JUnit – Calculator Combinatorics
Developed and executed a suite of unit tests for a Calculator class implementing combinatorial logic using the JUnit framework. Designed and implemented various test cases to validate correct behavior for typical, boundary, and invalid inputs, including exception handling for non-integer, zero, negative, and out-of-range values.

Java Unit Testing with JUnit – Car Rental System Classes
Executed unit testing for object-oriented classes in a Car Rental System using the JUnit framework. Designed and implemented comprehensive test cases for core components such as Car and RentalRecord, covering constructor correctness, state transitions, business logic, fee calculations, and edge cases. Demonstrated skills in systematic test design, exception handling, and validation of class methods to ensure high reliability and maintainability of Java application code.

API Testing with Postman – Book API
Applied practical skills in API testing by designing and executing automated test suites for a RESTful Book API using Postman. Developed test cases for key endpoints—including status checks, resource filtering, order creation, and client registration—using JavaScript assertions to validate responses. Utilized environment variables and test scripts to handle dynamic data and chained requests, demonstrating proficiency in automated API validation, data-driven testing, and robust quality assurance for web services.

API Performance Testing with JMeter – Book API
Acquired hands-on experience in API performance and load testing by designing and executing comprehensive test plans in Apache JMeter for a RESTful Book API. Configured thread groups to simulate concurrent users, implemented GET and POST requests for various endpoints, and used config elements for dynamic test data. Developed assertions to validate response codes and messages, and utilized JMeter listeners for detailed result analysis. Demonstrated the ability to automate, monitor, and analyze API performance for scalable web services.

Automated UI Testing with Selenium WebDriver and JUnit – E-Commerce Website
Developed and automated comprehensive UI test cases for a live e-commerce website using Selenium WebDriver with Java and the JUnit framework. Designed and executed test scripts to validate critical functionalities including login, sorting, filtering, search, product management, checkout (with multiple payment options), and user profile operations. Demonstrated expertise in web automation, scenario-based testing, and robust validation of user workflows for enhanced software quality assurance.

JavaScript Unit Testing with Jest – Equivalence Class Testing
Applied systematic unit testing techniques in JavaScript using Jest to validate business logic through Strong Normal, Weak Robust, and Strong Robust equivalence class test cases. Designed and implemented a suite of automated tests for the validateSalesInput function, ensuring thorough input validation and robust error handling for various boundary and invalid conditions. Demonstrated proficiency in structured test design, test automation, and quality assurance for reliable software development.

Getting Started
To explore any lab task, navigate to its respective folder and follow the instructions provided in the README or code comments. For running test cases:

JUnit: Import into your Java IDE and run as JUnit test.

Postman: Import the collection and environment into Postman and run tests.

JMeter: Open the .jmx file in JMeter GUI and execute the test plan.

Selenium/JUnit: Ensure the correct WebDriver is configured and run the test class.

Jest: Install dependencies with npm install and run npm test.

Happy Testing!
